<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1) The Shawshank Redemption(1994)</h3>
<p>
   The Shawshank Redemption shows how hope can beat all adversities. It shows how an innocent man Andy Dufresne gets sentenced to life imprisonement. It shows how he struggles to be at the shawshank where he makes a new friend named Red. This movie is my all time best.

<h3>2) 3 Idiots(2009)</h3>
<p>
   Every Engineering aspirant must watch this movie. It shows how people live in colleges. This is a story of 3 friends who meet in college and share many funny, emotional and tense moments together. It also shows new perspective of living life, focusing on excellence than success. AAL ISS WELL.

<h3>3) Bajrangi Bhaijaan(2015)</h3>
<p>
   It is an emotional movie with great humour. It show the life of a simple man Pawan who meets a Pakistani girl who gets lost in India. Pawan tries his best to send the little girl back to her home but fails, so he decides that he will himself drop the little girl to her home in Pakistan. This movie shows love can beat hate any day.
